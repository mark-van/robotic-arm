# Robotic Arm

I completed the software portion for my team's design of a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. 
Documentation for my work on this project is available on the following webpage:  
https://mark-van.github.io/robotic-arm/

Summary of Accomplishments:
-  Modeled motor, amplifying, and other systems while considering non-linearities to create a detailed simulation of the armâ€™s performance using MATLAB, Simulink, and SimulationX
-  Devised path planning, sensor, and PID firmware to replicate simulated results on hardware

My two teammates focused on the hardware and electrical aspects of the design.
